## Features & Usage

- If the user is not logged in they are redirected to the login page.
- If they are already logged in, they are redirected from the login page to the dashboard/chat list.
- Messages and message previews are updated as soon as the message is sent.
- Users get an alert icon for new messages and it disappears when clicking the message.
- A user can create a new chat with people they haven't messaged yet.
- If the user tries to create a new chat with someone they already have a chat with, they just get redirected and their message is sent in the original chat.
